# Credits

First of all, I want to thank the people behind [Bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Main_Page). The documentation was extensive and without it, I never would've started on this project.

Secondly, I'd like to extend my thanks to Alex "IsoFrieze" Losego from the [Retro Game Mechanics Explained](https://www.youtube.com/c/retrogamemechanicsexplained) Youtube channel. His videos on the topic of Gen 1 sprite decompression were pretty helpful.

I don't know the identity of the authors of the Pokémon gen 1 and 2 ROM maps on http://datacrystal.romhacking.net, but these were a valuable resource as well.

I also want to thank the community behind the [pokecrystal](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/) project. Without them, I wouldn't as easily have found the rom offsets of the pokémon front sprites for Pokémon Crystal.

Furthermore I like to develop the developers of the [libdragon](https://github.com/DragonMinded/libdragon) project as this project likely wouldn't have been feasible without it. I especially want to thank [Rasky](https://github.com/rasky) who helped me with some issues I encountered during development.

Thanks to the [PkHex](https://github.com/kwsch/PKHeX) project as well, because its code was useful to me to get the event flag offsets for G/S/C games and figure out the GS ball event flags. I may also use their codebase as a reference in the future in order to try to support the gen 1/2 games in other languages.

And of course I'd like to extend my thanks to everyone else in the pokémunity who wrote documentation or code for these old pokémon games. 

I've listed the specific resources I used for reading the rom/save game data in the CREDITS.md file of the libpokemegb project.
