# Credits

## Documentation / Other Projects

First of all, I want to thank the people behind [Bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Main_Page). The documentation was extensive and without it, I never would've started on this project.

Secondly, I'd like to extend my thanks to Alex "IsoFrieze" Losego from the [Retro Game Mechanics Explained](https://www.youtube.com/c/retrogamemechanicsexplained) Youtube channel. His videos on the topic of Gen 1 sprite decompression were pretty helpful.

I don't know the identity of the authors of the Pokémon gen 1 and 2 ROM maps on http://datacrystal.romhacking.net, but these were a valuable resource as well.

I also want to thank the community behind the [pokecrystal](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/) project. Without them, I wouldn't as easily have found the rom offsets of the pokémon front sprites for Pokémon Crystal.

Furthermore I like to develop the developers of the [libdragon](https://github.com/DragonMinded/libdragon) project as this project likely wouldn't have been feasible without it. I especially want to thank [Rasky](https://github.com/rasky) who helped me with some issues I encountered during development.

Thanks to the [PkHex](https://github.com/kwsch/PKHeX) project as well, because its code was useful to me to get the event flag offsets for G/S/C games and figure out the GS ball event flags. I may also use their codebase as a reference in the future in order to try to support the gen 1/2 games in other languages.

I'd also like to extend my thanks to "[The Gears of Progress](https://github.com/GearsProgress)", [LJ Birdman](https://x.com/LJSTAR_), [LuigiTKO](https://x.com/LuigiTKO), [GuiAbel](https://x.com/guiabel/) and [SourApple](https://github.com/SoupPotato) of the [Poke Transporter GB](https://github.com/GearsProgress/Poke_Transporter_GB) project for allowing me to use their logo and even create the Fennel picture asset for this project. It looks amazing, you guys! Much better than anything I could've created!

And of course I'd like to extend my thanks to everyone else in the pokémunity who wrote documentation or code for these old pokémon games. 

I've listed the specific resources I used for reading the rom/save game data in the CREDITS.md file of the libpokemegb project.

## Testing/Validation

Thank you to all folks who reached out with feedback and who did some testing. Some even went above and beyond, therefore I would like to specifically name them here.
